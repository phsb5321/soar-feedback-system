# Architecture Documentation

## System Architecture

### [HEXAGONAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](./HEXAGONAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)
Complete documentation of the hexagonal architecture pattern implementation in the SOAR Feedback System.

**Key Topics:**
- Ports and Adapters pattern
- Domain-driven design principles
- Dependency inversion implementation
- Clean architecture boundaries
- Service layer organization

## Architecture Principles

### Core Concepts
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between business logic and infrastructure
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules independent of low-level details
- **Testability**: Architecture supports comprehensive unit and integration testing
- **Maintainability**: Modular design enables easy feature additions and modifications

### Implementation Benefits
- ✅ **Clean Code**: Well-organized, readable, and maintainable codebase
- ✅ **Testable**: Easy to mock dependencies and test business logic
- ✅ **Flexible**: Can swap implementations without affecting core business logic
- ✅ **Scalable**: Architecture supports growth and feature expansion
